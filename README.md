Here's my intended order for this:

1. Complete `list_excercises.py` (get it to run with no errors and assertions passing)
2. Complete `tree_excercies.py`
3. Complete `graph_excercises.py`
4. Have fun in `model.py` and create a sample graph using the framework setup in `graph.py`, which has 
   some example data for everything you want to represent.

We can talk about anything at any point! 

And then when we get to a point of feeling good about the plan for a model, next steps are:

5. loading real Discogs metadata into the framework (I imagine this code will be mostly reusable when we switch backends, so we can get it working on our local version first)
6. changing to backends to the server provider that you like (does PocketBase have a graph DB, was that the plan?)
7. implementing the app, frontend, user features
